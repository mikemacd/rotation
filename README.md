# rotation
This is an experiment I originally wrote around 1988 in Amiga Basic. It is a program which will load and draw a three dimensional object. The math needed to do this I wouldn't learn 'officially' until several years later in university. 

As a coding challenge I ported this program to C under linux/solaris using X11 around 1996.

Once again I have undertaken as an exercise to rewrite this application, this time (2017) in Go.
